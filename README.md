drawing characters from adventure time with Turtles()

This project was created for Computing Arts/Humanities 22/FA

The intention was to illustrate three characters from the show Adventure Time using Turtles() in Google Collab. I played around with different approaches to create outlines of different identifying shapes that when combined would make up a character. The three characters created were Finn the Human, B.M.O., and Lumpy Space Princess. I used functions to run the lines of code making up each individual shape.
